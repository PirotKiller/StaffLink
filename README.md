# Configuration: `config.yml`

The `config.yml` file is automatically generated upon the first run of the StaffLink plugin. This file allows server administrators to customize the plugin's behavior, connect to Discord, and manage the list of reportable staff members.

## Example `config.yml`:

```yaml
